# EmperorGPT
Ever have that itch to scratch where you need to ask the Emperor of Mankind's opinion on something?
Well now with the power of GPT 3.5-Turbo, you can!

## Public Bot
I run this personally right now. I would do a backflip if this blew up to the point
where I needed to expand the hosting of this bot, so feel free to invite it!

### [InviteBot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1142656425118683307&permissions=277025737792&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

## Self-Hosting
Setting this up is relatively easy. You can either clone the repo and start it like a normal program, or use Docker.

This is based on [TSCord](https://github.com/barthofu/tscord), so refer to that documentation if needed.
